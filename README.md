# highlight-page-when-on-that-page

How to highlight the page navigation button? Simple... just follow the code I've provided in html file, the explaination is given there.

Still in this repo you'll learn how you can highlight a certain link when on that page... 
For example-
you have this page of your... there are three links on this page-
home link
about link
contact link

now when you click on home link, you got rendered to the home page but there won't be any indication there on the page that you are currently on the home page, so you want to make such cool setup so that whenever someone presses on home link, they got rendered to that page plus THEY CAN SEE SOMETHING LIKE AN UNDERLINE UNDER HOME LINK.
by doing this user can easily navigate through pages while knowing on what page the user currently is!
