Add a class to the body that matches the page youâ€™re on. For instance, on the about page use

<body class="about">

Now add an ID to each of your nav links which also ties it to the page, for instance

<a id="about" href="/about/">About</a>

Now in your CSS add a rule for each page/link as follows:

<style>
body.about #nav #about,
body.contact #nav #contact,
body.home #nav #home
{
  /* Add your active styles here */
  color: #cc0000;
  font-weight: bold;
  }
  </style>
